## File Map

### Claude Workspace (`.claude/`)
| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `.claude/agents/` | Repo-local specialist agent prompts for focused tasks such as chess logic, DB schema work, and screen building. |
| `.claude/commands/` | Repo-local reusable command prompts for recurring workflows such as adding screens/entities and debugging board or training flows. |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | Local Claude workspace settings for this repository. |

### Entry
| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `MainActivity.kt` | Single-Activity host. Holds `currentScreen` and screen-specific state used for screen routing, renders the active screen via `when`. |

### Screens (`ui/screen/`)
| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `HomeScreen.kt` | Lists all saved games. Opens a game in `GameEditorScreen`. |
| `CreateOpeningScreen.kt` | Form to input and save a new game/opening. Uses `PgnImportService` for PGN header extraction, SAN-to-UCI import, and batch-saving imported variation lines as separate games. |
| `CreateTrainingScreen.kt` | Creation-only training flow: loads all games with weight 1, paginated list with weight +/- and delete, Save calls `createTrainingFromGames` directly. No `trainingId` param, no edit-mode code. Exports shared `internal` helpers used by `EditTrainingScreen`: `DEFAULT_TRAINING_NAME`, `TrainingGameEditorItem`, `CreateTrainingEditorState`, `decreaseTrainingGameWeight`, `increaseTrainingGameWeight`, `GameEntity.toTrainingGameEditorItem`. |
| `EditTrainingScreen.kt` | Edit-only training flow: loads only games already in the training with their saved weights, "Random" button in top bar, GO button per row, Save calls `updateTrainingFromGames`. Missing training shows dialog navigating to Training list. |
| `TrainingListScreen.kt` | Loads and displays all saved trainings as cards with name, training ID, and games count. |
| `GamesExplorerScreen.kt` | Loads all saved games, shows each as a `GameBlock` (title + move-chip row + nav). Clicking any chip loads that game at that ply on the shared board. |
| `GameEditorScreen.kt` | Loads a single `GameEntity`, replays its PGN, shows move-chip row, allows undo/redo/save/delete. |
| `positions/PositionSearchScreen.kt` | Position search screen. Lets users move existing board pieces by default, optionally select palette pieces for placement, edit side/castling/FEN, save positions, and navigate edit history from the bottom action bar. |
| `positions/PositionSearchSaveDialog.kt` | Save-position dialog and state for `PositionSearchScreen`. |
| `PositionSearchCastles.kt` | Castling-right controls used by position search. |
| `TrainingComponents.kt` | Shared composables and pure helpers reused by both training-related and editor screens (see below). |
| `ScrenTypes.kt` | `sealed class ScreenType` - Home, Training, GamesExplorer, CreateOpening, PositionSearch, CreateTraining, EditTraining, GameEditor, TrainSingleGame, Stats, Profile, Settings, SmartTraining, SmartSettings, SmartTrainGame, and more. |
| `ProfileScreen.kt` | Profile screen - hero card with avatar/level/progress, quick stats, achievements list, settings/clear-data action rows. Container + Stateless pattern backed by `ProfileViewModel`. |
| `ProfileViewModel.kt` | Holds `ProfileState` (userName, level, totalMoves, accuracy, bestStreak, achievements) via `StateFlow`. No DB access - state is static defaults for now. |
| `SmartSettingsScreen.kt` | Smart Training session settings: Max Lines stepper and Only Games with Mistakes toggle. Container loads/saves values from `UserProfileEntity` via `UserProfileService.updateSmartSettings`. Navigated to from the gear icon in `SmartTrainingScreen`; back returns to `SmartTraining`. |

### Single-game training (`ui/screen/trainSingleGame/`)
| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `TrainSingleGameScreen.kt` | Main single-game training screen orchestration and screen shell. |
| `TrainSingleGameModels.kt` | Session models, enums, results, constants, and pure helpers. |
| `TrainSingleGameLogic.kt` | Training session flow helpers and state transitions. |
| `TrainSingleGameComponents.kt` | UI composables for the single-game training screen. |
| `TemporaryWrongWayStartOneSingleTraining.kt` | Temporary launcher that resolves the first valid training/game pair before opening `TrainSingleGameScreen`. |

### Shared UI components (`ui/components/`)
| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `AppIcons.kt` | **All shared styled icon composables live here.** Currently: `SettingsIconButton` (Settings icon, `TrainingAccentTeal` tint), `HintIconButton` (Lightbulb icon, `TrainingAccentTeal` tint, configurable size). **Always add new icon composables here — never define them inline in a screen or component file.** |
| `AppSlider.kt` | `AppNumberSlider(value, min, max, onValueChange)` — single-thumb slider styled with teal accent: current value label centered above the thumb, `Slider`, min/max edge labels below. Matches `EditTrainingMoveRangeSection` visual style. Use for any integer-value picker. |
| `AppTopBar.kt` | Standard top bar with title, optional subtitle, and back button. |
| `AppBottomNavigation.kt` | Bottom nav bar; `defaultAppBottomNavigationItems()` returns the standard item list. |
| `BoardActionNavigationBar.kt` | Shared bottom action bar for board screens. Matches app bottom-navigation sizing/styling and exposes `BoardActionNavigationItem(modifier, selected, enabled, onClick, content)` for action buttons and test tags. |
| `AppScreenScaffold.kt` | Screen scaffold wrapper used by all screens. |
| `Buttons.kt` | `PrimaryButton`, destructive button, and other shared button composables. |
| `Surfaces.kt` | `CardSurface` and other surface/card wrappers. |
| `Texts.kt` | `CardMetaText`, `NavLabelText(maxLines = 1)`, and other shared text composables. |
| `Inputs.kt` | `AppSearchField` and other input composables. |
| `AppDialogs.kt` | `AppMessageDialog` and other dialog composables. |
| `MoveChip.kt` | Move chip composable (teal when selected). |
| `ChessBoardSection.kt` | Square-aspect-ratio board with rounded corners. |

### Board (`ui/`)
| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `ChessBoard.kt` | Canvas-based board renderer + touch input. Driven by `GameController`. |

### Game Logic (`boardmodel/`)
| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `GameController.kt` | Wraps `chesslib.Board`. Manages move list, undo/redo, `boardState` (Compose int-state that triggers recomposition), `canUndo`, `canRedo`. |
| `BoardModel.kt` / `ChesslibMapper.kt` | Maps chesslib FEN to `BoardPosition` used for rendering. |

### Data (`entity/`)
| Entity | Table | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `GameEntity` | `games` | id, white, black, event, eco, pgn, initialFen, sideMask |
| `PositionEntity` | `positions` | zobristHash, fen, sideMask |
| `GamePositionEntity` | `game_positions` | gameId, positionId, ply |
| `TrainingTemplateEntity` | `training_templates` | id, name, gamesJson |
| `TrainingEntity` | `trainings` | id, name, gamesJson (copy of template, weights decremented as user completes games) |
| `UserProfileEntity` | `user_profile` | id (always 1), rankTier, rankTitle, simpleViewEnabled, removeLineIfRepIsZero, hideLinesWithWeightZero, hideSmartTrainingInfoCard, smartMaxLines (default 10), smartOnlyWithMistakes (default false) |

### Repository (`repository/`)
| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `DatabaseProvider.kt` | Singleton facade over Room DB. Public API includes game add/update/delete, training creation/list loading, and single-game training launch/finish helpers. |
| `GameDao`, `PositionDao`, `GamePositionDao`, etc. | Room DAO interfaces. |

### Services (`service/`)
| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `GameSaver.kt` | Transactional save: checks position uniqueness (Zobrist), inserts game + all positions. |
| `GameUpdater.kt` | Transactional game replacement flow: removes old links/positions as needed, deletes old game row, saves edited game again through `GameSaver`. |
| `GameDeleter.kt` | Transactional delete: removes game links, deletes the game, then deletes or updates affected positions. |
| `GameUniqueChecker.kt` | Returns true if at least one position in the game hasn't been seen for this side. |
| `PgnImportService.kt` | Extracts PGN headers, expands nested PGN variations into separate playable lines, converts SAN text into UCI moves, and builds stored PGN/move lists for `CreateOpeningScreen`. |
| `TrainingService.kt` | Creates trainings from game lists, lists trainings, validates training integrity, decreases line weight after completion. |
| `TrainSingleGameService.kt` | Loads game data for single-game training, finishes a trained line, resolves first launchable training/game pair. |
| `UserProfileService.kt` | Reads and writes `UserProfileEntity`. Key methods: `getProfile()`, `updateSettings(...)`, `updateSmartSettings(maxLines, onlyWithMistakes)`, `setHideSmartTrainingInfoCard(hide)`, `updateRankTitle(tier, title)`. |

### Global errors (`ui/error/`)
| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `AppErrorReporter.kt` | Global unexpected-error reporter. `AppErrorReporter.report` rethrows `CancellationException`, logs unexpected errors with tag `ChessBoardAppError`, and exposes `AppErrorUiState` for the shell dialog. `CoroutineScope.launchAppCatching` wraps app-shell jobs. |

Expected, user-facing validation errors stay local to the screen. Unexpected shell-level coroutine failures should go through `AppErrorReporter`.

## Shared PGN helpers — `service/PgnImportService.kt`

All PGN/UCI logic lives here. Check before writing new helpers.

| Symbol | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ParsedGame` | data class | `GameEntity` + `uciMoves: List<String>` + `moveLabels: List<String>` |
| `parsePgnMoves(pgn)` | fun | Regex-extracts UCI tokens from the app's stored PGN format |
| `computeLabel(move, fen)` | fun | Returns algebraic notation (incl. promotion/check/mate) for a move given the FEN before it |
| `buildMoveLabels(uciMoves)` | fun | Replays UCI list from start, returns `List<String>` of algebraic labels |
| `parsePgnToUci(pgnText)` | fun | Converts standard SAN PGN to a single UCI move list |
| `parsePgnToUciLines(pgnText)` | fun | Expands all PGN variations into separate UCI lines |
| `buildStoredPgnFromUci(uciMoves, event, …)` | fun | Builds the app's stored PGN format from UCI strings |
| `extractPgnHeaders(pgnText)` | fun | Extracts PGN header tag map (e.g. "Event", "ECO") |
| `uciMovesToMoves(uciMoves)` | fun | Converts UCI strings to chesslib `Move` objects |

## Shared composables — `ui/screen/training/TrainingComponents.kt`

| Symbol | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MoveChip(label, isSelected, onClick, unselectedBackground)` | @Composable | Teal when selected, `unselectedBackground` (default `SurfaceDark`) otherwise |
| `ChessBoardSection(gameController)` | @Composable | Square-aspect-ratio board with rounded corners |

## GameController Key API

```kotlin
// Navigation
fun undoMove(): Boolean
fun redoMove(): Boolean
fun resetToStartPosition()

// Load a full game and park at targetPly (redo still works past targetPly)
fun loadFromUciMoves(uciMoves: List<String>, targetPly: Int = uciMoves.size)

// Move input (board interaction)
fun tryMove(from: String, to: String): Boolean
fun setStartSquare(square: String?): Boolean
fun setDestinationSquareAndTryMove(dest: String?): Boolean
fun setOrientation(orientation: BoardOrientation)

// Compose-observable state
var boardState: Int
var currentMoveIndex: Int
var canUndo: Boolean
var canRedo: Boolean

// Export
fun getFen(): String
fun getMovesCopy(): List<Move>
fun generatePgn(): String
```

## Navigation Pattern

```text
MainActivity
|- currentScreen: ScreenType  (mutableStateOf)
|- selectedGame: GameEntity?  (passed to GameEditor)
|
\- when(currentScreen) {
     Home            -> HomeScreenContainer
     Training        -> TrainingListScreenContainer
     GamesExplorer   -> GamesExplorerScreenContainer
     CreateOpening   -> CreateOpeningScreenContainer
     CreateTraining  -> CreateTrainingScreenContainer
     GameEditor      -> GameEditorScreenContainer(selectedGame)
     TrainSingleGame -> TemporaryWrongWayStartOneSingleTraining
     Stats / Profile -> (placeholder)
   }
```

## Training System Design

- **TrainingTemplateEntity** - immutable set of games with weights (`gamesJson: [{gameId, weight}]`)
- **TrainingEntity** - mutable copy of a template; weights decrease as user completes games; entry removed when weight hits 0; training deleted when list is empty
- `TrainingService.validateTraining(trainingId)` removes broken game references and deletes empty trainings
- `TrainSingleGameScreen` decrements weight through `TrainSingleGameService.finishTraining(...)`
- There is also direct training creation from UI via `createTrainingFromGames(...)`, not only template-copy creation

## Rules

### Patterns to follow
- Screen files use **Container + Stateless** - state and DB calls in `XyzScreenContainer`, pure UI in `XyzScreen`
- DB operations on `Dispatchers.IO`, CPU-heavy work on `Dispatchers.Default`, UI state updates on `Dispatchers.Main`
- All DB access through `DatabaseProvider` - never call DAOs directly from screens
- Transactional game save/update/delete through `GameSaver`, `GameUpdater`, `GameDeleter`
- Navigation state lives in `MainActivity`; add new screens to `ScreenType` and the `when` block
- Check `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/commands/` before inventing new repo guidance; prefer reusing those repo-local prompts when they match the task

### Repo-local Claude Agents
- `.claude/agents/chess-logic.md` - use for move generation, PGN/FEN handling, legality, and board-state reasoning
- `.claude/agents/db-schema.md` - use for Room entities, DAOs, schema shape, and persistence design changes
- `.claude/agents/screen-builder.md` - use for Compose screen structure, screen wiring, and UI implementation patterns

### Repo-local Claude Commands
- `.claude/commands/add-entity.md` - workflow for introducing a new entity/table and associated persistence wiring
- `.claude/commands/add-screen.md` - workflow for adding a new screen and routing it through the app
- `.claude/commands/board-debug.md` - debugging checklist for board interaction and game-state issues
- `.claude/commands/training-check.md` - validation checklist for training flows and data integrity

### Business logic placement
- **All business logic lives in `service/`** - screens and containers hold only UI state and dispatch calls; they never compute, validate, or transform domain data themselves
- When adding logic to a screen, ask: "could this be a pure function in a service?" If yes, put it there
- New service methods should be **small and single-purpose** - one method per operation, named after what it does (`resolveX`, `buildX`, `validateX`), not after who calls it
- Helpers that are only used inside one composable file are fine to stay private in that file **only if they are pure UI helpers** (formatting, layout math); anything touching domain models or DB results belongs in a service

### Before starting non-trivial work
- **Always ask clarifying questions before taking big actions** — if the task is ambiguous, multi-step, or touches several files, ask first instead of diving in
- When the user says "continue", ask what they want to continue rather than inferring from memory and acting immediately

### Agent and tool discipline
- **Never spawn the Explore agent when the target files are already known** — the File Map above lists every key file; read them directly with the Read tool instead. Explore is only for genuinely unknown locations.
- **Never spawn any agent just to read files you could read yourself** — agents cost 3-5× more tokens than direct reads and add latency. Use agents only for open-ended searches across many unknown files.

### Don't
- Don't duplicate logic that belongs in `TrainingComponents.kt`
- Don't create new files unless no existing file is a reasonable home
- Don't add comments or docstrings to code you didn't change
- Don't over-engineer; solve only what was asked
- Don't put business logic in screens - if a container does more than load state and call a service, extract the logic
- **Never define styled icon composables inline in any screen or component** — always add them to `ui/components/AppIcons.kt` first, then import from there. This applies to every new icon, no exceptions.

### Keeping this file up to date
After any non-trivial change update the relevant section above - correct file paths, API signatures, or add to Recent Changes.

## Recent Changes

- **Position search naming completed** - The position-search route, containers, dialogs, test tags, runtime context, and training-flow callbacks now consistently use `PositionSearch` / `positionSearch` / `OpenPositionSearch` naming. Files include `positions/PositionSearchScreen.kt`, `positions/PositionSearchSaveDialog.kt`, and `PositionSearchCastles.kt`.

- **Position search board controls moved to the shared bottom action bar** - The old in-content position controls were removed. `PositionSearchBoardControlsBar` now uses `BoardActionNavigationBar` with White, Black, Reset, Clear, Back, and Forward actions. Back/Forward use `PositionSearchSnapshot` / `PositionSearchHistory` to undo and redo board edits, side changes, reset, and clear.

- **Position search placement defaults fixed** - No palette piece is selected by default, so tapping an empty board no longer places a white king. Existing pieces can be moved immediately. Selecting a palette piece enables placement; tapping the selected palette piece again unselects it. The selected-piece text label under the board was removed, palette pieces render with the same canvas glyph renderer as board pieces, and the FEN block is three rows tall.

- **Create opening bottom controls use shared navigation styling** - `CreateOpeningBoardControlsBar` now uses `BoardActionNavigationBar` with White, Black, Reset, Back, and Forward actions. Undo/Redo labels and content descriptions were renamed to Back/Forward. White/Black use the shared king vector icon to avoid glyph clipping.

- **Global unexpected-error handling added** - `ui/error/AppErrorReporter.kt` centralizes app-shell error reporting. `MainActivity` owns global `appError` state and shows `AppMessageDialog` for reported failures. Shell coroutines use `launchAppCatching`; expected screen validation errors remain handled locally.

- **Targeted test fixes** - `PositionSearchScreenTest.openPositionSearchSaveDialog()` waits for the initial FEN before saving duplicate positions, avoiding the duplicate-position race. `GamesExplorerCardSelectionTest.gameBlock_clickingCardSelectsGameAtInitialPly` clicks the tagged card near its top-left corner so child move chips do not consume the card-selection click.

- **`SmartSettingsScreen.kt` added; `SmartTraining` settings moved to DB** - `smartMaxLines` (default 10) and `smartOnlyWithMistakes` (default false) added to `UserProfileEntity`. DB migrated 13→14 via two `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` statements. `UserProfileService.updateSmartSettings(maxLines, onlyWithMistakes)` saves both fields atomically. `SmartSettingsScreenContainer` loads the profile on launch and writes on every change (no save button). `SmartTrainingScreenContainer` now reads these values from the profile and uses them when building the training queue; the Max Lines stepper and Only Games with Mistakes toggle are removed from `SmartTrainingScreen`. A teal gear `SettingsIconButton` in the Smart Training top bar navigates to `ScreenType.SmartSettings`.

- **`ui/components/AppIcons.kt`** - Canonical home for all shared styled icon composables. Contains `SettingsIconButton` and `HintIconButton`. Every new icon composable must be added here first — never inline in a screen or component.

- **`CreateTrainingScreen.kt` cleaned up to creation-only** - Removed all edit-mode leftovers: `trainingId` param, `buildTrainingEditorItems`, `resolveCreateTrainingTitle`, `resolveRandomTrainingGameId`, `saveTraining` helper, `CreateTrainingScreenData`, `MissingTrainingDialog`, `TrainingSaveSuccess.wasUpdated`, `onStartGameTrainingClick`, `isEditMode` branches, and `showStartButton` from `TrainingGamesPage`/`TrainingGamePageRow`. `CreateTrainingScreenContainer` now calls `createTrainingFromGames` directly. Save success dialog always says "Training Created".

- **`EditTrainingScreen.kt` redesigned with per-game board blocks** - `EditTrainingScreen` body replaced with a `LazyColumn`. Each game in `editableGamesForTraining` is rendered as a `GameTrainingBlock` (private) that shows: header row with title/ECO/weight (left) and `-`/`+`/`GO` buttons (right); a live `ChessBoardSection` loading the game PGN via `parsePgnMoves` + `buildMoveLabels` on `Dispatchers.Default` and parking at ply 0; a "Move Sequence" label row with teal accent; a horizontally scrollable `MoveChip` row with chip selection synced to `gameController.currentMoveIndex`; and a bottom nav row with a `TextButton("Reset")` and `←`/`→` `IconButton`s using `Icons.AutoMirrored`. `TrainingGameEditorItem` extended with `eco: String?` and `pgn: String` fields; `GameEntity.toTrainingGameEditorItem` updated to populate them. Container logic is unchanged.

- **`CreateTrainingScreen.kt` split into `CreateTrainingScreen.kt` + `EditTrainingScreen.kt`** - Creation flow (`CreateTrainingScreenContainer` / `CreateTrainingScreen`) is now in `CreateTrainingScreen.kt` with no `trainingId` param; edit flow (`EditTrainingScreenContainer` / `EditTrainingScreen`) is in `EditTrainingScreen.kt`. Shared low-level composables (`TrainingGamesEditorSection`, `TrainingGamesPage`, `TrainingGameBlock`) and helpers stay in `CreateTrainingScreen.kt` with `internal` visibility. `ScreenType.EditTraining(trainingId: Long)` added to `ScrenTypes.kt`. `MainActivity` routes `EditTraining` to `EditTrainingScreenContainer` and returns to `EditTraining` after `TrainSingleGame`. `TrainingListScreen` and `HomeScreen` `onOpenTraining` now navigate to `ScreenType.EditTraining`. `TrainSingleGameLauncherScreen` error dismiss also navigates to `EditTraining`.

- **`ProfileScreen.kt` + `ProfileViewModel.kt`** - Profile feature added under `ScreenType.Profile`. `ProfileScreenContainer` uses `remember { ProfileViewModel() }` to collect `ProfileState` and delegates to stateless `ProfileScreen`. Screen contains hero card (avatar, level badge, progress bar), quick stats row (accuracy, best streak, achievements count), achievements list with lock/unlock state, and an action menu with Settings and Clear All Data rows. Wired into `MainActivity` before the `else` branch.

- **Multi-line PGN import** - `PgnImportService.kt` now expands nested PGN variations into separate lines, and `CreateOpeningScreen.kt` saves imported lines as separate games on Save while still previewing the first line on the board.
- **`.claude` workspace documented** - `CLAUDE.md` now documents the repo-local `.claude/agents`, `.claude/commands`, and local settings file so future work can reuse those prompts as project context.
- **`PgnImportService.kt` ownership** - PGN import parsing for `CreateOpeningScreen.kt` now lives in `service/PgnImportService.kt`. The screen handles only UI state, dispatching the import job, and applying imported headers/moves to the controller.
- **`TrainingListScreen.kt` and training route split** - `ScreenType.Training` now opens a dedicated list of saved trainings. Each card shows the training name, DB ID, and games count parsed from `gamesJson`. The old `TrainingScreen.kt` role was renamed to `GamesExplorerScreen.kt` and moved under `ScreenType.GamesExplorer`.
- **`ChessBoard.kt` drag-and-drop** - replaced tap-only `detectTapGestures` with `awaitEachGesture` that distinguishes tap vs drag by `viewConfiguration.touchSlop`. During drag: piece at origin is skipped in normal draw pass and re-drawn centered on the finger (on top). On release, target square is bounds-checked (off-board = no move), then `setStartSquare` + `setDestinationSquareAndTryMove` validate and attempt the move. Two-tap flow still works for taps. All `GameController` mutations moved out of the Canvas draw block into gesture callbacks (`ChessBoardWithCoordinates`). `ChessBoard` is now a pure renderer.
- **`GameController.loadFromUciMoves(uciMoves, targetPly)`** - loads a full game from UCI strings and parks at `targetPly`; all moves kept so undo/redo works across the whole game; single `boardState++` at end
- **Shared logic extracted to `TrainingComponents.kt`** - `parsePgnMoves`, `computeLabel`, `buildMoveLabels`, `MoveChip`, `ParsedGame` moved from both screen files into one canonical location
